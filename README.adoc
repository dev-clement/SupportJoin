This project is aiming to make a web page where enginees (developpers) can either create project or even upvote some that are already present to the platform.

== Introduction
Using the vote of some developpers, you'll then be able to see all the open-source projects where peoples are working on. And you'll be able to help those you like, or even discuss with them !

People can then either upvote some projects ideas / content or even join the projects directly. Also user can ask questions or event put some comments regarding the project presentation.

== Project overview
This project is done in order to work on Java application using some spring frameworks. But also keep improving my skills as a passionate developper ! That's also why I am doing the project as this project isn't my idea, but a friend who told me to work on something like this. And I'm very grateful for what she did !

Now less feeling talk, let's talk about the project and how he's going to be develop.

== Project overview
This project will be a web project, that means he'll contains the following layers:

. Front-end
. Middleware
. Back-end

=== Front-end
The front-end part (that is the presentation layer) will be done using one of my favorite framework named Angular.

The use of Angular has been chosen because of the way that Angular is made up and all the features this language provides. Which are:

* Keep the codebase clean and organised with an opinionated component model and flexible dependency injection system
* Angular component that will help you splitting your code into well-encapsulated parts
* The versatile dependency-injection helps you to keep your code modular, loosely coupled and testable using NgMock.
* Our fine-grained reactivity model, combined with compile-time optimisations, simplifies development and helps build faster apps by default.

=== Middleware
As said above, the middleware will be implemented using Angular as well as the front-end of the application.

Middleware is a concept that is coming from Laravel, what it does is basically run between each request made by a router at a specific route. So the middleware will then be able to either authorized the user, or redirect it somewhere he has the rights to be.

=== Back-end in Java
As this project has been done in order to test out the Java and its framework named Spring-boot, that's what is going to be used for the back-end part.

==== Spring
Spring makes programming jave quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring's focus on speed, simplicity and productivity has made it the world's most popular java framework.

==== Spring-boot
Spring-boot makes it easy to create a stand-alone, production based spring based application that you can "just run".

Moreover, Spring-boot contains some good features that spring doesn't that are to name a few:

* Create stand-alone spring applications
* Embed tomcat, jetty or underflow directly (no need to deploy a war file)
* Provide opinionated starter dependencies to simplify your build configuration

=== Database
MariaDB has been used around the world for almost 20 years from now on. MariaDB Server is a leading open source relational database, developed by the original creators of MySQL. Renowned for its speed, scalability, and robustness, it serves a wide range of applications, from banking to websites, and powers notable platforms like Wikipedia and WordPress.com. Originally designed as a drop-in replacement for MySQL, MariaDB Server offers an enhanced feature set, including a rich ecosystem of storage engines and plugins.

MariaDB is a database that is considered as a relational database ported by SQL. That means that each table can have a relationship with each other, thatâ€™s why some architectural choice will then be made.
